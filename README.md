## About üìñ

This mod adds a spell to the game that lets you unlock doors and chests from a distance, as long as it doesn‚Äôt require a key. It's extremely light weight, only runs scripts each time it's cast, and uninstalling it is easy. It‚Äôs very close to Oblivion‚Äôs unlock spells, but with some additional quality of life features. Just like in Oblivion, using it in front of guards won't get you into trouble. The spell was designed with game balance in mind, if you don‚Äôt like my default settings, I have given you 5 global variables so you can tweak it to your satisfaction.

You can obtain the spell by buying it from Belethor's General Goods, Bits and Pieces, Gray Pine Goods, Riverwood Trader, and The Pawned Prawn.

There is only one Unlock spell to learn, and it doesn‚Äôt matter what your alteration skill is, you can always bruteforce any lock open with enough magicka. The better you are at alteration, the less magicka it will take to unlock things. Practice with the spell, and you will be awarded XP in the alteration school for it, tougher locks yield higher XP. If you get the perks that cut your alteration spell costs by half, it will apply to locks matching that level. Perhaps you consider yourself crafty, in that case, you can use enchantments to bring down your alteration spell cost and use potions to increase your magicka. The point here is that the spell still works similarly to a vanilla one, while being packed into one spell.

## Features ‚öô

- Cast a spell that will open any lock that doesn‚Äôt require a key.

<ins>Details:</ins>

- The default base magicka cost range is 40 for novice, and 200 for master. You can adjust the cost range by setting 2 global variables, GM_SUS_Unlock_MagickaMax_Glob1, and GM_SUS_Unlock_MagickaMin_Glob1.
- The default skill increase range is at least 50 for novice locks, and 100 for master locks. You can adjust the skill increase range by setting 2 global variables, GM_SUS_Unlock_SkillMax_Glob1, and GM_SUS_Unlock_SkillMin_Glob1.
> Lock level 0 to 4 x ( ( max global - min global ) / 4 ) + min global

- The formula used to calculate magicka cost is:
> Base Cost x ( 1 - ( Alteration Mod / 100 ) ) x ( 1 - ( Alteration Skill / 400 )^0.65 )

- If you have an alteration perk that halves the spell cost, and you cast it on a lock that matches that perk's level, it halves the result:
> Magicka Cost / 2

- You can adjust the spell‚Äôs lock detection radius with the GM_SUS_Unlock_Radius_Glob1 global variable, the default value is 150.

Alteration Mod is the total value of all your Alteration spell cost reducing enchantments, and once that hits 100, the magicka cost is simply 0.

Some doors may be a little awkward to unlock, especially the jail doors in Riften. You can hit the door in different corners, or adjust the radius global to increase the spell‚Äôs detection radius.

<ins>Current limitations:</ins>

- You cannot open locks that require a key because it can break things, especially quests.
