## About

This mod adds a spell to the game that lets you unlock doors and chests from a distance, as long as it doesn’t require a key. It's extremely light weight, only runs scripts each time it's cast, and uninstalling it is easy. It’s very close to Oblivion’s unlock spells, but with some additional quality of life features. Just like in Oblivion, using it in front of guards won't get you into trouble. The spell was designed with game balance in mind, while not perfect, it tries to avoid being immersion breaking.

You can obtain the spell by buying it from Belethor's General Goods, Bits and Pieces, Gray Pine Goods, Riverwood Trader, and The Pawned Prawn.

There is only one Unlock spell to learn, and it doesn’t matter what your alteration skill is, you can always bruteforce any lock open with enough magicka. The better you are at alteration, the less magicka it will take to unlock things. Practice with the spell, and you will be awarded XP in the alteration school for it, tougher locks yield higher XP. If you get the perks that cut your alteration spell costs by half, it will apply to locks matching that level. Perhaps you consider yourself crafty, in that case, you can use enchantments to bring down your alteration spell cost and use potions to increase your magicka. The point here is that the spell still works similarly to a vanilla one, while being packed into one spell.

## Features

- Cast a spell that will open any lock that doesn’t require a key.
- It will work at any skill level, provided you have enough magicka.
- Shhh - No one will notice, not even the guards.
- You can use the game mechanics to reduce the cost of opening locks.

<ins>Current limitations:</ins>

- You cannot open locks that require a key because it can break things, especially quests.
- Some doors may be a little awkward to unlock, especially the jail doors in Riften. The trick is to hit them in different corners, one of them is bound to work.
