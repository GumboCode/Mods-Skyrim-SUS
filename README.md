## About

This mod adds a spell to the game that lets you unlock doors and chests from a distance, as long as it doesn’t require a key. It's extremely light weight, only runs scripts each time it's cast, and uninstalling it is easy. It’s very close to Oblivion’s unlock spells, but with some additional quality of life features. Just like in Oblivion, using it in front of guards won't get you into trouble. The spell was designed with game balance in mind, while not perfect, it tries to avoid being immersion breaking.

There is only one Unlock spell to learn, and it doesn’t matter what your alteration skill is, you can always bruteforce any lock with enough magicka. The better you are at alteration, the less magicka it will take to unlock things. Practice with the spell, and you will be awarded XP in the alteration school for it, tougher locks yield higher XP. If you get the perks that cut your alteration magicka costs by half, it will apply to locks matching that level. If you are crafty enough, you can use enchantments to bring down your alteration spell cost and use potions to increase your magicka.

## Features

- Cast a spell to access a menu that lets you select an initial value to increase your weight by, 100, 1K, 10K, 100K, 1M.

- Selecting the disable option will completely remove the effect from the player for easy clean up.

<ins>Current limitations:</ins>

- This mod is not able to reduce your carry weight below its normal value, though I can certainly look into that in the future if anyone expresses interest.
- You can only set your own carry weight, it doesn’t affect your companions.
- You cannot set your carry weight to be any higher than 10M because it will start to negatively impact anything else giving you carry weight bonuses. I.g. It can give your Extra Pockets perk permanent reductions.
